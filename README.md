# Creating a Flowchart

A flowchart is used to visualize the functionality of your program, displays inputs, outputs, conditionals, every little thing that your program will be doing will be written in your flowchart.

Flowcharts can be as simple as this:

This flowchart shows the starting point, inputs, what those inputs result in, a conditional and its results, and the ending point.

Flowcharts are larger based on the complexity of your app, made to cover everything that your app will be able to do. An example of a slightly more complex flowchart is:

## Why Use a Flowchart?

Flowcharts are great ways to keep your project organized before you begin, preventing a mess of code created from trying to start something with no planning beforehand.

As the examples above show, standard practice has the start and end of a program shown as a circle (or a circular rectangle), inputs and outputs as trapezoids, conditionals as diamonds, and basic processes as rectangles. There are arrows connecting everything to show the exact flow. This visual indication allows everything to be seen clearly, making the plan when beginning to program much more clear.

## How To Make a Flowchart?

Flowcharts can be made in many different ways, hand-drawn or digitally made. If you're planning to go for, a very good recommendation is draw.io, however you can also use programs like Photoshop or Microsoft Paint if you prefer to, however they're more difficult to use than draw.io in this case. The digital approach is much simpler if you're using a program with shape tools, to keep your flowchart looking as clean as possible.
