# Creating a Storyboard

A storyboard in programming is similar to something you would see in TV and movies for planning shots. In programming, a storyboard is a visual representation of your app, planning out the screens that you'll be showing to your users. A storyboard is a good way to plan out what your site will look like before you start programming to prevent further issues down the lines if you were trying to wing it.

Storyboards can be made easily on websites like https://www.figma.com/, but can also be created on programs like Photoshop. On top of these methods, storyboards can be hand-drawn, whatever helps you visualize your site the most.
